### Program language used: Python, Excel

Introduction:
The management of inventories is crucial for any organization, as poor inventory management can lead to financial and operational issues. The goal of this project is to assist a manufacturing business in choosing the right amount of inventory for a vital engine component. The objective is to minimize total inventory cost, which comprises holding and ordering costs. In order to determine the predicted minimum total cost, order quantity, and annual number of orders, the project involves creating and implementing a decision model using Excel and Python, doing what-if analyses, and conducting simulations.
